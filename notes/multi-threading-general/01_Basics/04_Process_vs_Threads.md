## Relationship Between Threads and Processes

#### Processes
A process is an instance of a program in execution. It is a self-contained unit of execution that has its own address space, code, data, and system resources.
A process provides an isolated environment for the execution of a program, ensuring that one process does not interfere with another.

#### Threads
A thread, also known as a lightweight process, is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A thread shares the process's resources, such as memory and file handles, but has its own execution context, including the program counter, register values, and stack.

#### Relationship
**Multithreading**: A single process can contain multiple threads, all running concurrently within the same address space. Multithreading allows a process to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving the efficiency and responsiveness of applications.

**Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process share the process's resources, making inter-thread communication and data sharing more efficient than inter-process communication. However, this shared access requires synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

**Isolation vs. Efficiency:** Processes provide isolation between different executing programs, while threads provide a way to divide a single program into multiple concurrent execution paths. Using threads within a process is more efficient than using multiple processes, as threads have lower overhead in terms of memory and resource allocation.

**Independence**: While threads share the same process resources, they can execute independently of each other. This independence is crucial for concurrent execution and for exploiting parallelism on multi-core processors.
