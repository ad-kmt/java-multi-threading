# Race Condition
## Introduction
A race condition is a concurrency issue that occurs in a multithreaded or multiprocess environment when two or more threads or processes attempt to access and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and incorrect results.

## Characteristics of Race Conditions
- **Non-Deterministic Behavior**: The outcome of a race condition is unpredictable and depends on the timing and interleaving of the threads' execution.
- **Data Corruption:** Race conditions can lead to corrupted data or inconsistent state if multiple threads modify the same resource without proper synchronization.
- **Difficult to Debug:** Race conditions can be challenging to reproduce and debug because they depend on the specific timing of thread execution.

## Common Scenarios Leading to Race Conditions
- **Checking and Updating a Shared Resource**: When threads check the state of a shared resource and make decisions based on that state, another thread may modify the resource in between, leading to incorrect actions.

## Preventing Race Conditions
- **Synchronization**: Use synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or synchronized blocks to ensure that only one thread can access and modify shared data at a time.
- **Atomic Operations:** Use atomic operations or classes provided by the programming language or library, such as AtomicInteger in Java, to perform thread-safe updates to shared data.
- **Thread-Local Storage**: Use thread-local storage to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the data, avoiding shared access.
