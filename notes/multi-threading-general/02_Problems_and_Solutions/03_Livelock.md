# Livelock in Multithreading
## Introduction
Livelock is a situation in concurrent programming where two or more threads are actively responding to each other's actions, but none can make progress and complete their tasks.

#### Livelock vs Deadlock
Unlike deadlock, where threads are blocked and waiting indefinitely, threads in a livelock are continuously changing their state in response to other threads, yet no thread can move forward.

## Characteristics of Livelock
- **Active Waiting:** Threads involved in a livelock are not blocked; they are actively performing operations, such as retrying an action or responding to other threads' states.
- **Lack of Progress:** Despite being active, none of the threads can complete their tasks or make any meaningful progress.
- **Cyclic Dependency:** The threads in a livelock often depend on each other's state, leading to a cyclic loop where each thread's progress is contingent on the other's actions.

## Example Scenario
1. Consider two threads, A and B, trying to acquire two shared resources, Resource1 and Resource
2. Both threads follow a protocol where they release their currently held resource if they can't acquire the other resource to avoid deadlock.
3. However, if both threads simultaneously acquire one resource and then release it to acquire the other, they can enter a livelock, continuously acquiring and releasing resources without completing their tasks.

## Causes of Livelock
- **Overly Cooperative Threads:** Threads that are designed to respond too quickly to each other's actions can lead to livelock, as they constantly adjust their state based on other threads' states.
- **Poorly Designed Retry Mechanisms:** If retry logic is not carefully designed, threads may end up in a loop of retrying actions without making progress.
- **Incorrect Synchronization Logic:** Misuse of synchronization constructs or incorrect implementation of protocols can lead to livelock situations.

## Avoiding Livelock
- **Introduce Randomness:** Adding randomness to the decision-making process or retry intervals can help break the symmetry and prevent livelock.
- **Backoff Strategy:** Implementing a backoff strategy, where threads wait for a random or increasing amount of time before retrying, can reduce the chances of livelock.
- **Priority Assignment:** Assigning priorities to threads and resources can help ensure that at least one thread can make progress.
