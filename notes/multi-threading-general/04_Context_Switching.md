## Context switching
Context switching is a fundamental operation performed by the operating system (OS) to manage the execution of multiple threads or processes on a single CPU core.

It involves saving the state of the currently executing thread or process and loading the state of the next thread or process to be executed.

This allows the CPU to switch between different threads or processes, enabling multitasking and efficient use of system resources.

### Key Components of Context Switching:

**Saving the Current Context**: The OS saves the current state of the executing thread or process, including the program counter (PC), CPU registers, and memory allocation information. This saved state is often stored in a data structure known as a context or a process control block (PCB).

**Loading the Next Context**: The OS selects the next thread or process to be executed based on scheduling algorithms and loads its saved state into the CPU registers and memory. This prepares the CPU to resume execution from where the thread or process left off.

**Switching**: The actual switch from the current context to the next context is performed, and the CPU begins executing the new thread or process.

### Impact of Context Switching:

**Overhead**: Context switching introduces overhead because it requires time to save and load contexts, during which the CPU is not performing useful work.

**Thrashing**: Excessive context switching can lead to reduced system performance, a phenomenon known as thrashing.

**Scheduling**: The efficiency of context switching depends on the scheduling algorithm used by the OS to determine the order in which threads or processes are executed.

**Concurrency**: Context switching is essential for achieving concurrency in multitasking operating systems, allowing multiple threads or processes to share the CPU and execute seemingly simultaneously.

Overall, context switching is a critical mechanism in modern operating systems that enables multitasking, concurrency, and efficient utilization of system resources.

## Thread's Context
A thread's context, also known as its execution context or thread context, includes all the information that the thread needs to resume its execution after a context switch. This includes:

**Program Counter (PC)**: The address of the next instruction to be executed.

**CPU Registers**: The current values of the CPU registers, including the accumulator, index registers, stack pointer, and general-purpose registers.

**Stack**: The thread's call stack, containing local variables, method call information, and return addresses.

When a context switch occurs, the operating system saves the current thread's context and loads the context of the next thread to be executed. This allows multiple threads to share the same CPU core while maintaining their own independent execution states.
