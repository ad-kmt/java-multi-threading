# Low Level and High Level Concurrency Primitives in Java
## Introduction
Java provides a range of low and high level concurrency primitives and utilities to facilitate the development of multithreaded applications. These tools offer different levels of abstraction and control, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate mechanism for their specific use case.

## Low-Level Synchronization Primitives
Low-level primitives are the basic building blocks for synchronization and coordination between threads.

#### Synchronized Keyword
- Used to create synchronized methods or blocks.
- Ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized code at a time.
- Relies on the intrinsic lock of the object for synchronization.

#### Object Locks and Intrinsic Locks
- Every object in Java has an intrinsic lock associated with it, which is used for synchronized blocks and methods.
- The lock is implicitly acquired and released by the JVM when entering and exiting synchronized blocks or methods.

#### wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() Methods
- Used for inter-thread communication within synchronized blocks or methods.
- wait() causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll().
- notify() wakes up a single waiting thread; notifyAll() wakes up all waiting threads.

#### volatile Keyword
- Declares a variable as volatile, ensuring visibility of its changes across threads.
- Provides a lightweight synchronization mechanism for variables accessed by multiple threads.

#### Thread.join()
- Allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
- The calling thread blocks until the specified thread terminates.

####  Thread.sleep()
- Causes the currently executing thread to pause its execution for a specified duration, allowing other threads to execute.


## High-Level Concurrency Utilities
High-level utilities provide more sophisticated mechanisms for managing and coordinating threads.

#### Executor Framework
- Simplifies the execution of asynchronous tasks with a pool of worker threads.
- Key interfaces and classes include `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, and `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

#### Concurrent Collections
- Thread-safe versions of standard collection classes designed for concurrent access.
- Examples include `ConcurrentHashMap`, `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, and `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

#### Synchronization Aids
- Classes that help manage the state and coordination of multiple threads.
- Includes `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`, and `Phaser`.

#### Atomic Variables
- Supports lock-free, thread-safe operations on single variables.
- Classes in the` java.util.concurrent.atomic` package include `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and `AtomicReference`.

#### Future and Callable
- Interfaces for representing and managing the result of asynchronous computations.
- `Future` provides methods to check if the computation is complete and retrieve its result.
- `Callable` represents a task that returns a result and can be executed by an ExecutorService.
