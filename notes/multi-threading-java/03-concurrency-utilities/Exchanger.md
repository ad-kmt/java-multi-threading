# Exchanger in Java
## Introduction
The `Exchanger` class is a synchronization point provided by the `java.util.concurrent` package in Java, where two threads can exchange objects. It is particularly useful in applications where pairs of threads need to exchange data periodically, such as in genetic algorithms or pipeline designs.

## How Exchanger Works
- An `Exchanger` object is a rendezvous point (agreed time and place) where two threads meet to exchange data.
- Each thread presents some object on the exchange and receives the object provided by the other thread.
- If a thread arrives and the other thread is not yet present, the first thread will block until the other thread arrives.

## Example Usage
```java
public class ExchangerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Exchanger<String> exchanger = new Exchanger<>();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                String producedData = "Data from Producer";
                String receivedData = exchanger.exchange(producedData);
                System.out.println("Producer received: " + receivedData);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                String receivedData = exchanger.exchange(null);
                System.out.println("Consumer received: " + receivedData);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
In this example, a producer thread and a consumer thread exchange data using an `Exchanger`. The producer provides some data, and the consumer receives it. Both threads synchronize their actions using the `exchanger.exchange()` method.

## Use Cases
- **Data Processing Pipelines:** In scenarios where a sequence of transformations needs to be applied to data, and each transformation is handled by a separate thread.
- **Genetic Algorithms:** Where two threads might exchange genetic information to create new offspring solutions.
- **Producer-Consumer Patterns:** Where producers and consumers need to exchange buffers or data containers.

## Advantages
- Simplifies the design of inter-thread communication when only two threads need to exchange data.
- Provides a clear and concise mechanism for data exchange, reducing the likelihood of errors compared to more complex synchronization methods.
